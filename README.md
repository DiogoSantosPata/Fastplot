<h1>How to use it: </h1>
<p> From your console type: <br> 
<i> python web_viz_udp.py </i> <br> 
That will setup a Tornado server to communicate between python and javascript. 
Next, open  <i> index.html </i> in your favorite browser.
Now, you are all set to let your python script perform its crazy computations and all you need to do to 
plot data is to call the <i>sender()</i> function. 

Try to run <i>main.py</i> as an example to see it in action.
