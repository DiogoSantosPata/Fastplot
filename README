fastplot

Fast and real-time plotting in Python is still far from being achieved. 
fastplot takes advantage of the rendering capabilities of modern web-browsers and Javascript to quickly update visualisations. 
Get the best of both worlds: Python to compute, JavaScript to render. 
As you can see this package its still in early stage.... please help :)
